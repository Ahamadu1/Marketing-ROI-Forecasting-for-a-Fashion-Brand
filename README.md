# Marketing-ROI-Forecasting-for-a-Fashion-Brand
# 🧠 Marketing ROI Forecasting for a Fashion Brand

## 📄 Overview
This project analyzes and forecasts the marketing performance of a fashion brand using data analytics and machine learning.  
It evaluates multiple marketing channels — **Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Email, SMS, Influencer Marketing, and Organic Content** — over a 24-month period to identify the most profitable and efficient platforms.

Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**, the project measures KPIs such as:
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
- **LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)**
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**
- **CPM (Cost per Mille)**
- **Conversion Rate**

A **machine learning model** (Linear Regression) predicts ROI trends for each channel over the next two years, helping visualize which strategies are most likely to drive long-term growth.

## 🧮 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Imported and merged all marketing data by month and channel.

2. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
   Calculated ROI, CAC, LTV, and other performance metrics.

3. **Visualization:**  
   Created ROI-over-time and ROI-by-channel plots to observe patterns and trends.

4. **Forecasting:**  
   Trained Linear Regression models for each channel to predict ROI over the next 24 months.

5. **Evaluation & Insights:**  
   Compared actual vs predicted trends to draw strategic conclusions.

## 💡 Insights & Conclusion
- **Influencer Marketing** and **Google Ads** showed the strongest revenue scaling and ROI performance.  
- **Organic Content** demonstrated steady growth and is projected to **surpass paid channels in ROI efficiency** over the next two years.  
- **Email** and **SMS** remain reliable for retention and strong LTV:CAC ratios.  
- The model suggests future marketing budgets should focus on **influencer + organic synergy**, supported by consistent paid acquisition.

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Integrate non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for deeper insights.  
- Add seasonality features for more accurate monthly ROI prediction.  
- Expand dataset to include engagement and conversion breakdowns per campaign.
